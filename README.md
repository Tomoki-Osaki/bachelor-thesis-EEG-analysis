Using EEG, whether conscious change of attention could affect the activation of the mirror neuron system (MNS) was investigated.
Participants watched the videos of sign language as counting the model's body movemenets (count task, as the baseline) or guessing the meaning of sign language (meaning task).
Furthermore, because previous research has shown the MNS is activated more after practice, participants watch the same video three times; namely, before practice, as imitating, after practice.
As a result, neither the effects of conscious change of attention nor practice were not observed.
Specifically, the reason the effect of practice was not observed was that in this study, sign language was not similar to any body movements participants see in every day, while the previous research used the writing movement as an unfamiliar actions.
